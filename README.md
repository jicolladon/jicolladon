## üëã About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm **Joan Isaac Collado Navarro**, a passionate **Software Engineer** specializing in **.NET, backend development, and modern architectures**.  
Currently, I am working at **Picis Clinical Solutions**, where I build healthcare software to improve patient care and clinical workflows.

I enjoy exploring new technologies, especially within **.NET**, while keeping sight of the bigger picture‚Äîtechnology should always serve business insights. My main focus is on designing clean, scalable, and maintainable solutions.

ÔøΩ I‚Äôm finishing my **Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Engineering (UOC)**, with only my **Final Master Thesis (TFM)** pending.

‚ö° _Fun fact:_ I began my career as a **stretcher-bearer in hospitals**‚Äîtoday, I combine that experience with my technical skills to create better healthcare IT systems.
